## Tutorial: Installing Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Mac

### Step 1: Download Python

1. Open a web browser and go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/.
2. Click on the "Downloads" tab on the navigation bar.
3. Scroll down and choose the latest stable version of Python for macOS. For example, as of now, you can choose Python 3.9.7.
4. Click on the download link for the macOS installer.
5. Once the download is complete, open the downloaded file (e.g., python-3.9.7-macosx10.9.pkg) to run the installer.

### Step 2: Installing Python

1. In the Python installer, double-click on the package file to start the installation.
2. The installer will guide you through the installation process. Click "Continue" and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. On the "Installation Type" screen, make sure to select the option "Install for all users of this computer" and click "Continue".
4. Click "Install" to begin the installation process. You may be prompted to enter your administrator password.
5. Once the installation is complete, you will see a "The installation was successful" message.

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

1. Open the Terminal application by going to "Applications > Utilities > Terminal".
2. In the Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   This command will display the version of Python installed on your system. If it shows the version number (e.g., Python 3.9.7), Python is successfully installed.

### Step 4: Installing Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. In the Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   pip3 install jupyter
   ```
   This command will install Jupyter Notebooks using the pip package manager.

### Step 5: Launching Jupyter Notebooks

1. Open the Terminal application.
2. In the Terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server.
3. The Jupyter Notebook interface will open in your default web browser.
4. You can create a new notebook by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Python 3" under the "Notebooks" section.
5. You can now start writing code in Jupyter Notebooks.

Congratulations! You have successfully downloaded and installed Python, as well as Jupyter Notebooks, on your Mac machine. You are now ready to start using Jupyter Notebooks for Python programming and data analysis.

Remember to periodically update Python and Jupyter Notebooks to the latest versions to take advantage of new features and security updates.
